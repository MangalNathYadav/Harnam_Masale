Cart Model Implementation - Harnam Masale Desktop Version
===============================================

Overview
--------
The cart implementation in Harnam Masale's desktop version is a sophisticated system that handles both guest users and authenticated users, with Firebase Real-time Database as the primary storage mechanism and localStorage as a fallback option.

Architecture
-----------
1. State Management
   - Uses a centralized cart array to maintain the current cart state
   - Implements flags for initialization status and Firebase usage
   - Maintains guest ID tracking for anonymous users

2. Storage Mechanisms
   Primary: Firebase Real-time Database
   Fallback: Browser's localStorage
   
3. User Types Support
   - Authenticated Users: Cart data stored in Firebase under user ID
   - Guest Users: Cart data stored in Firebase under generated guest ID
   - Fallback Mode: localStorage when Firebase is unavailable

Key Components
-------------
1. Cart Initialization (initializeCart)
   - Checks user authentication status
   - Determines appropriate storage mode
   - Handles initialization of cart data
   - Implements error fallback mechanisms

2. Firebase Mode Management
   a) User Mode (switchToFirebaseMode)
      - Retrieves existing user cart from Firebase
      - Merges any existing guest cart items
      - Cleans up guest data after successful merge
   
   b) Guest Mode (switchToGuestFirebaseMode)
      - Generates/retrieves guest ID
      - Manages guest ID expiration (7-day validity)
      - Retrieves guest cart from Firebase
      - Implements localStorage fallback

3. Cart Operations
   - Add to Cart: Handles product validation and quantity management
   - Save Cart: Implements storage strategy based on current mode
   - Cart Merging: Smart merging of guest and user carts during login

Security Features
---------------
1. Guest ID Management
   - Unique guest ID generation using timestamp and random suffix
   - 7-day expiration mechanism
   - Secure cleanup of guest data after user login

2. Error Handling
   - Graceful degradation to localStorage when Firebase is unavailable
   - Data validation before storage
   - Backup mechanisms for cart data

Data Persistence Strategy
-----------------------
1. Primary Storage (Firebase)
   - User cart: /user_carts/{userId}
   - Guest cart: /guest_carts/{guestId}

2. Backup Storage (localStorage)
   - Cart data: 'harnamCart'
   - Guest ID: 'harnamGuestId'
   - Guest ID expiration: 'harnamGuestIdExpires'

Performance Optimizations
-----------------------
1. Cart Operations
   - Efficient merging algorithms for cart items
   - Minimal storage operations
   - Background saving mechanisms

2. State Management
   - Prevention of duplicate initialization
   - Efficient cart updates
   - Optimized data structure for quick access

Error Recovery
-------------
1. Firebase Unavailable
   - Automatic fallback to localStorage
   - Continued functionality in offline mode
   - Data sync when connection is restored

2. Data Corruption
   - Validation checks on cart data
   - Automatic recovery from invalid states
   - Backup data maintenance

Integration Points
----------------
1. Authentication System
   - Seamless integration with Firebase Auth
   - Support for custom authentication (HarnamAuth)
   - Guest to user transition handling

2. UI Integration
   - Cart count updates
   - Real-time cart synchronization
   - Error state handling and user feedback
