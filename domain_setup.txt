Absolutely, I can guide you through connecting your Hostinger domain to your Netlify-deployed website. Here's a step-by-step process to ensure a seamless integration:

---

### üîó **Connecting Hostinger Domain to Netlify**

#### 1. **Add Your Domain to Netlify**

* Log in to your [Netlify dashboard](https://app.netlify.com/).
* Navigate to your site and go to **Domain management**.
* Click on **Add custom domain**.
* Enter your Hostinger domain (e.g., `harnam-masale.com`) and click **Verify**.
* Once verified, confirm by clicking **Add domain**.([Netlify Support Forums][1], [Netlify][2], [mikkvillem.com][3])

#### 2. **Configure DNS Settings in Hostinger**

* Log in to your [Hostinger account](https://www.hostinger.in/).
* Go to **Domains** and select your domain.
* Click on **DNS/Nameservers**.
* You'll have two options to connect your domain to Netlify:([Netlify][4], [Shopify Help Center][5], [YouTube][6])

  **Option A: Use Netlify DNS (Recommended for full control)**

  * In Netlify, under **Domain management**, locate the provided Netlify nameservers.
  * In Hostinger, replace the existing nameservers with the ones provided by Netlify.
  * This method allows Netlify to manage all DNS records, including SSL certificates and redirects.([Netlify][4], [Netlify Support Forums][7], [Netlify Support Forums][8])

  **Option B: Configure External DNS (If you prefer to manage DNS elsewhere)**

  * In Netlify, under **Domain management**, select **Awaiting External DNS** next to your domain.
  * Netlify will provide specific DNS records (A records and CNAME) to add in Hostinger.
  * In Hostinger, add these records under **DNS Zone Editor**.
  * This method allows you to retain DNS management in Hostinger while pointing your domain to Netlify.([Netlify][9], [Hostinger][10], [mikkvillem.com][3])

> **Note:** DNS changes can take up to 48 hours to propagate globally.([Hostinger][11])

### üîê **Enable HTTPS for Your Domain**

* After DNS propagation, return to Netlify's **Domain management**.
* Netlify will automatically provision an SSL certificate for your domain.
* Ensure that **HTTPS** is enabled to secure your site.([Netlify][2])

---

### üìå **Additional Tips**

* If you encounter issues with email services after DNS changes, ensure that MX records are correctly configured in your DNS settings.
* For detailed guidance, refer to Netlify's official documentation on [configuring external DNS](https://docs.netlify.com/domains/configure-domains/configure-external-dns/).([Netlify][12])
