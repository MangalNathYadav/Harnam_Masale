# 10. Error Handling & Offline Support

## Overview
Robust error handling and offline support ensure the app remains usable and secure even when network or backend issues occur. The system provides clear feedback, fallback mechanisms, and data persistence strategies for both desktop and mobile users.

## Features
- Graceful error handling for all Firebase operations
- Fallback to localStorage for cart and user data when offline
- Placeholder data for products if Firebase is unavailable
- Client-side form validation and clear error messages
- Image loading errors handled with placeholders and base64 support
- Backup mechanisms for cart data
- Secure guest ID management with expiration and cleanup
- Real-time UI updates reflecting error states

## Implementation
- **Scripts:**
  - `js/cart.js`, `js/auth.js`, `js/products.js`, `js/checkout.js`, `js/orders.js`
  - `mobile_harnam_food/js/mobile-cart.js`, `mobile_harnam_food/js/mobile-auth.js`, `mobile_harnam_food/js/mobile-products.js`
  - Admin scripts: `admin/js/admin-common.js`, `admin/js/admin-logs.js`
- **Fallbacks:**
  - Cart and user data fallback to localStorage for offline/guest use
  - Product data fallback to dummy/placeholder data
  - UI feedback for errors and offline status

## Data Persistence Strategy
- Primary: Firebase Realtime Database
- Backup: localStorage for guests and offline mode
- Guest cart: `/guest_carts/{guestId}` with expiration
- User cart: `/users/{uid}/cart`

## Security
- Data validation before storage
- Error logging in `admin_logs/`
- Secure cleanup of guest data after login
