- Persistent shopping cart (syncs between devices for logged-in users, localStorage fallback for guests)
- Order processing, checkout, and order history
- Admin dashboard for product, user, order, and site management
- QR code assets for marketing and packaging
- Fully responsive, mobile-first design
- Modern UI/UX with dark theme and animation effects

Firebase services used:
- **Authentication**: Secure user and admin login, custom claims for admin roles
