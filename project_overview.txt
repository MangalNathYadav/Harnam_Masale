## 1. Platform Architecture

Harnam Masale is a modern, client-side e-commerce web application for selling Indian spices, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and powered by Firebase for authentication, database, and storage. The platform features:

- User authentication (signup, login, password reset, profile management)
- Product catalog with advanced filtering, search, and responsive grid
- Persistent shopping cart (syncs between devices for logged-in users, localStorage fallback for guests)
- Order processing, checkout, and order history
- Admin dashboard for product, user, order, and site management
- QR code assets for marketing and packaging
- Fully responsive, mobile-first design
- Modern UI/UX with dark theme and animation effects

Firebase services used:
- **Authentication**: Secure user and admin login, custom claims for admin roles
- **Realtime Database**: Product catalog, user profiles, orders, settings, logs
- **Storage**: Product and banner images, founder photo, etc.

4. `renderProducts()` generates product cards in the DOM
5. Event listeners attach for filtering, sorting, and cart actions

### Cart Flow
1. User clicks "Add to Cart" on a product (handled by universal cart buttons)
2. `addToCart()` processes the product and adds it to the cart array
3. Cart is saved to Firebase (for logged-in users) or localStorage (for guests)
4. Cart UI updates to reflect changes (count badge animation)
5. Visual feedback confirms item was added (button animation, notification)
6. User can view cart by clicking the cart icon in navigation
7. Cart modal shows items with quantity controls and totals

2. Loading overlay shows authentication in progress
3. Firebase authentication processes the request with error handling
4. On success, user data is fetched from Firebase database
5. User session is established in both Firebase and localStorage
6. Cart data is synchronized between guest storage and user's Firebase cart
7. UI updates to reflect logged-in state (user menu with profile photo)
8. User-specific data (orders, profile) becomes available
9. Redirect to appropriate page (home or requested protected page)
10. When logging out, cart and session data are properly cleared
