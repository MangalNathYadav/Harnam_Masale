## 4. Data Flow

### Product Display Flow
1. `products.js` initializes when product pages load
2. `fetchProducts()` retrieves products from Firebase
3. Products are processed (sorting, image handling)
4. `renderProducts()` generates product cards in the DOM
5. Event listeners attach for filtering, sorting, and cart actions

### Cart Flow
1. User clicks "Add to Cart" on a product (handled by universal cart buttons)
2. `addToCart()` processes the product and adds it to the cart array
3. Cart is saved to Firebase (for logged-in users) or localStorage (for guests)
4. Cart UI updates to reflect changes (count badge animation)
5. Visual feedback confirms item was added (button animation, notification)
6. User can view cart by clicking the cart icon in navigation
7. Cart modal shows items with quantity controls and totals
8. User can modify quantities or remove items with real-time updates
9. On proceeding to checkout, cart data is transferred to the checkout page
10. After successful order placement, cart is cleared

### Authentication Flow
1. User submits login/signup form with validation
2. Loading overlay shows authentication in progress
3. Firebase authentication processes the request with error handling
4. On success, user data is fetched from Firebase database
5. User session is established in both Firebase and localStorage
6. Cart data is synchronized between guest storage and user's Firebase cart
7. UI updates to reflect logged-in state (user menu with profile photo)
8. User-specific data (orders, profile) becomes available
9. Redirect to appropriate page (home or requested protected page)
10. When logging out, cart and session data are properly cleared
